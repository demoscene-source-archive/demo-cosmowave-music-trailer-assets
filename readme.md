## Overview

In july 2000, [astrofra](https://github.com/astrofra) joined the people of the _demoscene_ group `Orion` for a 48h period. During the VIP2 demoparty, they worked on a small demo to announce the release of a music compilation. As of 2023, this release, `Cosmowav Music Disc` is still to come.<br>
The demo runs on Windows32 an relies on DirectX. It might need a legacy emulation layer to run a more recent OS :blush:<br>
In order to document this period, for preservation purpose, here are the 3D & 2D art files that resulted in this production.

You will find the following kind of files: :floppy_disk:
* `.LWO`, Lightwave 3D files, mostly the original 3D models
* `.MAX`, 3DSMax files, scenes, vertex color baking (if any), animations
* `.3DS`, 3DStudio legacy files, required by the Orion 3D engine
* `.PNG`, `.PSD`, texture files
* `.AUR`, TVPaint files (was called _Aura_ at that time)

## Artists

We worked in collaboration, on the graphics sides, blending 2D and 3D artworks: 
* Morgan `Splif` Thomas (main concept, 2D main concept art)
* Fran√ßois `Fra` Gutherz (3D scene, textures, export)
